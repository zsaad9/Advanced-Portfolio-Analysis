# Advanced-Portfolio-Analysis

Project Overview
This project involves developing a portfolio optimization model employing Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Monte Carlo simulations. The goal is to assess and enhance investment strategies, leading to a potential reduction in risk by 15% while maintaining target returns. The project utilizes Python for statistical analysis and visualization, integrating data from multiple financial APIs to evaluate over 200 assets, thereby optimizing the asset allocation process for a simulated investment portfolio.

Features
Data Fetching: Fetch historical stock data for 200 assets using the yfinance library.
Return and Risk Calculation: Calculate expected returns and covariance matrix from historical data.
Monte Carlo Simulations: Simulate future returns to assess potential investment outcomes.
Portfolio Optimization: Apply Markowitz MPT to find the optimal portfolio with minimum risk.
Efficient Frontier Plotting: Visualize the efficient frontier and the optimal portfolio.
Dependencies
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
yfinance
scipy
